Adjustable Precision Buffered Multiple
for Eurorack Synthesis Systems

Designed by Zack Hagan Feb 2018

This buffered mult is adjusted by a trimmer potentiometer on the front panel
to either exactly represent the original signal or slight amplify or attenuate
the original. This can be useful for getting VCOs pitch to track correctly,
especially when stacked with other VCOs.

BOM is all available from Mouser, except for the jacks - Thonk, Modular Addict,
Synthcube, or your local modular shop!
